## Project Overview
In this project, I provide a demonstration of quantitative model development
for risk management by feature engineering time series S&P 500 time series data
to transform it for improved stationarity and carrying out monte carlo simulations 
for monitoring price movement when observing our value at risk (VaR).

## Project Slides
Here is a link to my presentation covering an overview of the project:
